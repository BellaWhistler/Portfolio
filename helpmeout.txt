  Currently trying to figure out why my JS color cursor effect is not working or at least not showing up in the viewports above 34em/smartphone size. 
  Since I'm very new here on GitHub and teaching myself autodidactically, I'd appreciate any help/tips in hopes of eventually solving this problem. 

  Best, 
  Bella :)
